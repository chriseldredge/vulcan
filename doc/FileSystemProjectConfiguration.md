# Introduction #

The FileSystem plugin should only be used if you have a project you want to get building in Vulcan and you don't have it checked into a source repository.  It is highly recommended that you check your source files into a true version control system to realize the benefits that are provided.

# Configuration #

The only option for this plugin is the `Source Directory`.  Enter the location where Vulcan should find the source files you wish to build.  These files will be copied to the `Working Copy Directory` before building.
