		<p>Vulcan is hosted on GoogleCode using Subversion.</p>
		<p>To check out a working copy, first you'll need a subversion client.  If you haven't
			installed the svn command line tools, do so now.  Next, issue this command from your
			favorite command shell (after puting svn commands into your PATH):
		</p>
		<code>svn co http://vulcan.googlecode.com/svn/trunk vulcan</code>
		<p>This will create a sub-directory in your current working directory named vulcan,
			which will contain the source tree for the main web application.
		</p>
		<p>The standard plugins reside in the same repository.  Browsing the repository will quickly
			reveal the path that should be used to check them out.</p>
