			<span>WebLogic 9.0 &amp; Cglib</span>
			<p>WebLogic ships with an old version of cglib in weblogic.jar.  This causes a problem
				when the Spring Framework tries to use cglib to create subclasses on the fly.  To
				work around the problem, drop cglib 2.0 into your jre/lib/ext folder.</p>
		</div>

    	<div>
			<span>WebLogic 9.1 &amp; DOCTYPE</span>
			<p>WebLogic 9.1 fixes the cglib issue in 9.0 but introduces a different bug where
				JSP Documents (JSP 2.0 XML Documents) do not render the DOCTYPE declaration
				even when you ask it nicely.  This breaks JavaScript in Mozilla based browsers.</p>
		</div>

    	<div>
			<span>Shift-click to multi select checkboxes</span>
			<p>A convenience is provided where you can select multiple projects in any form
				in vulcan by checking one project and shift-clicking another one.  All of 
				the projects in between will be selected or deselected.  However, if you
				use Opera and click the label instead of the checkbox itself, this will
				not work.  It works fine in Firefox and IE.</p>
